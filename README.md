# Javascript - Projects

#### Repository intended to keep track of the projects I've built while learning JS, so most likely all the projects will be tweaked versions of projects from some course/tutorial I've watched and not my own ideas.

## **Project list**
### *Vanilla JS*
* ### Budgety
* ### Pig Game
* ### Expanding Cards
* ### Progress Steps
* ### Rotating Navigation
* ### Hidden Search
* ### Blurry Loading
